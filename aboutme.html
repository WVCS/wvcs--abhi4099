   <p1>
   I am currently 16 years old and a junior in high school. My hobbies include playing basketball, going to the beach, and video games. I also love to travel and explore new places, and go on hikes often in the canyon behind my house and other places. I took computer science in hopes of gaining knowledge about this evolving field, and I  must say I learned a lot and it was very interesting.
